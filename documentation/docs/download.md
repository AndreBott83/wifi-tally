!!! warning
    We use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).
    
    This means
    
    * We believe the code is stable enough to be used for production
    * everything before version 1.0.0 could be changed at any time without prior notice.
      You should expect pinouts to change, features to dissapear, etc. with any upgrade
    * We maintain a changelog that will notify you of significant changes
    * Starting with version 1.0.0 the layout and features can be considered stable in a sense
      that they might be improved, but in a backward compatible way
