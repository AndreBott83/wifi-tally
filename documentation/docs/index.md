# Open Source Tally Light

Wifi Tally is an Open Source Wifi Tally Light based on the ESP8266.

It aims to be affordable without sacrificing reliability and works with most
common video mixers.

Its architecture uses a central Hub that connects the tallies to the video mixer and
allows easy configuration and monitoring.
